# Techstack

This is the codebase that powers [stocknear's](https://stocknear.com/) backend, which is an open-source stock analysis research platform.

Built with:
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): Python Backend
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/): Nodejs Backend
- [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/): Database
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): Caching Data

# üöÄ Quick Start

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd stocknear-backend

# One-command setup
./init-docker.sh
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Initialize all databases
- ‚úÖ Create required directories and files
- ‚úÖ Build and start all Docker containers
- ‚úÖ Wait for services to be healthy
- ‚úÖ Test all endpoints

**Services will be available at:**
- FastAPI: http://localhost:8000
- Fastify: http://localhost:2000
- Redis: localhost:6380

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run without Docker:

1. Install Python 3.8+ and Node.js
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Initialize databases: `python3 init_db.py`
4. Start services manually

For detailed setup instructions, see [DOCKER_README.md](DOCKER_README.md).
